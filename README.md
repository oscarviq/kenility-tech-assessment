A new company needs to address these requirements:

Create a Node API with Nest.js.
Connect the Node API to MongoDB using nest/mongoose.
Implement JWT as an authentication strategy.

The company needs to store products with a name, SKU, picture (this has to be a file), and price. 
A product can be used to create orders. 
An order has an identifier, client name, total, and product list.

Develop the following endpoints:
  Create a product.
  Request a product.
  Create an order.
  Update an order.
  Get the total sold price in the last month.
  Get the higher amount order
  Bonus: Dockerize MongoDB and the Node API.
